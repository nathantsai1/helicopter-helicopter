# helicopter-helicopter
a fighter jet that I named as a helicopter and really don't want to change that
It has a cute little fan in the front

# things to know
* I learned more about css and animations. Instead of relying on programs like js, I learned how much css can affect a page, and light it up with colors
* Also, this project has to be in full screen
